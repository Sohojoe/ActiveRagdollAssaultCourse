# ActiveRagdollAssaultCourse
Research into Assault Course for training Active Ragdolls (using MujocoUnity+ml_agents)

## AssaultCourse001
* **Mujoco Model:** DeepMindHopper
* **Hypostheis:** Agent should be able to learn to traverse simple slopes without adding perception of height.
* **Outcome:** It worked - seams that it helps to have different slopes across the 16 agents. We needed a couple of iterations to get it right.
